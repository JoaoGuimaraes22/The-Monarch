# Character Manuscript Integration - Session Continuation Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ **Project Context: The Monarch Story Platform**

This is a continuation of building the **Character Manuscript Integration** system for The Monarch Story Platform - a comprehensive story development platform focused on practical utility over marketing fluff.

**Core Philosophy**: Build what's genuinely useful, component-first architecture, clean black/white/red aesthetic matching Claude interface.

## ðŸŽ‰ **COMPLETED: Flexible POV Assignment System (Steps 1-3)**

We successfully built a revolutionary **flexible POV scope system** that replaces rigid "single vs multi POV" toggles with intelligent scope-based assignments:

### **âœ… Step 1: Database Schema (COMPLETE)**

- **Added POVAssignment model** to Prisma schema with flexible scope system
- **Scope Types**: `novel | act | chapter | scene` (following CharacterState/RelationshipState pattern)
- **POV Metadata**: type, importance, notes, assigned by, reason
- **Relations**: Novel â†” POVAssignment â†” Character with proper cascading deletes
- **Migration**: Ready for `npx prisma db push`

### **âœ… Step 2: Service Layer (COMPLETE)**

- **POVService class** in `/lib/characters/pov-service.ts` following established patterns
- **Type-safe interfaces** with no `any` types, parameter object patterns
- **Core Methods**: CRUD operations, scope queries, statistics, character POV checks
- **Validation schemas** in `/lib/characters/pov-types.ts`
- **Barrel exports** through `/lib/characters/index.ts`

### **âœ… Step 3: API Routes (COMPLETE)**

- **Three API endpoints** following established middleware patterns:
  - `GET/POST /api/novels/[id]/pov-assignments` - Novel POV management
  - `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/novels/[id]/pov-assignments/[assignmentId]` - Assignment CRUD
  - `GET /api/novels/[id]/characters/[characterId]/pov-assignments` - Character POV queries
- **Proper validation** with Zod schemas and rate limiting
- **Type safety** with correct `validatedData` parameter handling
- **Error handling** using established `handleServiceError` patterns

## ðŸš€ **NEXT: Step 4 - React Hooks (IN PROGRESS)**

Need to create React hooks following established `useCharacters`/`useCharacterStates` patterns:

### **Required Hooks**:

1. **`usePOVAssignments(novelId)`** - Main POV management hook
2. **`useCharacterPOV(characterId)`** - Character-specific POV hook
3. **`useCreatePOVAssignment()`** - Simplified creation hook
4. **`useUpdatePOVAssignment()`** - Simplified update hook
5. **`useDeletePOVAssignment()`** - Simplified delete hook

### **Hook Location**: `/hooks/characters/pov/` (new directory)

### **Established Hook Patterns to Follow**:

- **Parameter objects** for creation/updates
- **Optimistic updates** for better UX
- **Loading/error states** for each operation
- **useCallback** for memoized functions
- **Type safety** throughout
- **Barrel exports** through index files

## ðŸŽ¯ **ULTIMATE GOAL: Character Manuscript Integration**

The POV system is **foundational** for the real goal - tracking character appearances in manuscript content:

### **Phase 1: POV Foundation (COMPLETE)**

âœ… Flexible POV assignment system with scope-based control

### **Phase 2: Character Mention Detection (NEXT)**

- **Text Analysis Engine**: Smart character name detection in scene content
- **Character Mentions Service**: Find all appearances with context snippets
- **Navigation Integration**: Click mention â†’ jump to exact manuscript location
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient processing of large manuscripts

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Character Manuscript Section (FINAL)**

- **POV Assignments Display**: Show character's POV scopes with visual indicators
- **Character Mentions List**: All appearances with before/after text context
- **Scene Navigation**: Seamless jump to specific mentions in manuscript editor
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Character screen time, appearance distribution

## ðŸ”§ **Architecture Requirements (CRITICAL)**

**ALWAYS follow these established patterns:**

### **No "any" Types Rule**

- Use proper TypeScript interfaces
- Type all service parameters with interfaces
- Use Zod schema inference for API types

### **Established /lib/api Middleware System**

- `composeMiddleware(withRateLimit(), withValidation())`
- `RATE_LIMIT_CONFIGS.STANDARD` / `.CREATION` (never `CREATE` or `DELETE`)
- `handleServiceError` for error handling
- `createSuccessResponse` for responses

### **Hook Patterns Like Manuscript Hooks**

- Parameter objects for complex operations
- Optimistic updates with rollback
- Separate loading states for each operation
- useCallback for memoized functions
- Consistent error handling

### **UI Component Library Integration**

- Use existing UI components (ComboSelect, Select, ArrayField, Card, Button)
- Follow dark theme (bg-black, bg-gray-900, text-red-500)
- Component organization in feature folders
- Clean component hierarchy

### **Clean Component Organization**

- Feature-based folder structure
- Barrel exports through index.ts files
- Separation of concerns (containers vs presentational)
- Reusable component patterns

## ðŸ’¡ **Revolutionary POV System Features**

### **Ultimate Flexibility Examples**:

- **Single POV Novel**: One assignment at novel scope â†’ "Marcus throughout"
- **Act-Based Hybrid**: "Acts 1-2 are Lyra, Act 3 is Marcus, Act 4 is shared"
- **Chapter Alternating**: "Even chapters Marcus, odd chapters Lyra"
- **Complex Multi-POV**: Scene-level assignments for maximum control

### **Smart Priority System**:

- More specific scopes override broader ones (Scene > Chapter > Act > Novel)
- Importance weighting for shared POV scenes
- Contextual POV tracking based on assignments

### **Character Manuscript Integration Benefits**:

- **Contextual POV Display**: Only shows POV features if character has assignments
- **Smart Mention Detection**: Finds "Marcus", "Lord Marcus", "the young captain"
- **Rich Context**: Shows surrounding text for each mention
- **Seamless Navigation**: Click mention â†’ exact manuscript location

## ðŸ“‹ **Session Handoff Checklist**

### **Completed and Working**:

âœ… Database schema with POVAssignment model  
âœ… POV service layer with full CRUD operations  
âœ… Three API endpoints with proper validation  
âœ… Type-safe interfaces and Zod schemas  
âœ… Rate limiting and error handling

### **Next Session Goals**:

ðŸŽ¯ **Step 4**: Create React hooks for POV management  
ðŸŽ¯ **Step 5**: Build character manuscript section UI  
ðŸŽ¯ **Step 6**: Implement character mention detection  
ðŸŽ¯ **Step 7**: Add navigation integration

### **Files Created This Session**:

- `/lib/characters/pov-service.ts` - Service layer
- `/lib/characters/pov-types.ts` - Types and validation schemas
- `/app/api/novels/[id]/pov-assignments/route.ts` - Novel POV API
- `/app/api/novels/[id]/pov-assignments/[assignmentId]/route.ts` - Assignment CRUD API
- `/app/api/novels/[id]/characters/[characterId]/pov-assignments/route.ts` - Character POV API
- Updated `/lib/characters/index.ts` - Barrel exports
- Updated `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added POVAssignment model

## ðŸš€ **Ready to Continue**

The flexible POV assignment foundation is complete and working. Next session should focus on building the React hooks layer, then move toward the ultimate goal of character mention detection and manuscript integration.

**Key Insight**: This POV system is revolutionary because it adapts to ANY narrative structure - from simple single POV to complex multi-character scenes - without forcing writers into rigid categories.
