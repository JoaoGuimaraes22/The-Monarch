# Character Relationships System - Complete Planning Summary

## üéØ System Architecture Overview

### Two-Tier Relationship Model

Following the proven Character ‚Üí CharacterState pattern:

**Base Relationships** (Static Foundation)

- `CharacterRelationship` model - permanent connection between characters
- Contains: baseType, origin, history, fundamentalDynamic, writerNotes
- Like the `Character` model - core identity that rarely changes

**Relationship States** (Temporal Evolution)

- `RelationshipState` model - how relationships evolve over time
- Contains: currentType, strength, trust/conflict levels, power balance, status
- Like the `CharacterState` model - temporal changes with story scope

### Bidirectional Records Strategy

- Store TWO database records for each relationship (A‚ÜíB and B‚ÜíA)
- Enables asymmetric relationships ("Lyra trusts Marcus more than Marcus trusts Lyra")
- Each character has their own perspective on the relationship
- Supports rich, nuanced storytelling

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

### CharacterRelationship Model (Enhanced)

```typescript
model CharacterRelationship {
  id              String @id @default(cuid())

  // Directional relationship
  fromCharacterId String
  fromCharacter   Character @relation("FromCharacter")
  toCharacterId   String
  toCharacter     Character @relation("ToCharacter")

  // STATIC foundation (never changes)
  baseType        String   // "family" | "romantic" | "professional" | "antagonistic" | "mentor_student" | "friendship"
  origin          String?  // "Childhood friends who became engaged"
  history         String?  // Background of the relationship
  fundamentalDynamic String? // Core pattern that doesn't change

  // Meta
  writerNotes     String?

  // NEW: Temporal evolution
  relationshipStates RelationshipState[]

  createdAt       DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime @updatedAt

  @@unique([fromCharacterId, toCharacterId])
}
```

### RelationshipState Model (New)

```typescript
model RelationshipState {
  id              String @id @default(cuid())

  relationshipId  String
  relationship    CharacterRelationship @relation(fields: [relationshipId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  // EVOLVING relationship state (changes over time)
  currentType     String   // "ally" | "enemy" | "romantic" | "neutral" | "complicated"
  subtype         String?  // "bitter enemies" | "secret lovers" | "estranged siblings"
  strength        Int @default(5) // 1-10 intensity

  // Status (public vs private)
  publicStatus    String?  // How they appear in public
  privateStatus   String?  // True nature of relationship

  // Emotional dynamics
  trustLevel      Int @default(5)    // 1-10
  conflictLevel   Int @default(1)    // 1-10
  powerBalance    String @default("equal") // "equal" | "a_dominant" | "b_dominant" | "shifting"

  // Temporal scope (same as CharacterState)
  scopeType       String   // "novel" | "act" | "chapter" | "scene"
  startActId      String?
  startChapterId  String?
  startSceneId    String?
  endActId        String?
  endChapterId    String?
  endSceneId      String?

  // Change tracking
  changes         String?  // JSON as string: what changed and why
  triggerSceneId  String? // Scene that caused this change

  createdAt       DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

## üèóÔ∏è Service Layer Architecture

Following established patterns from character-service.ts:

### RelationshipService (`/lib/characters/relationship-service.ts`)

```typescript
export interface CharacterRelationship {
  id: string;
  fromCharacterId: string;
  toCharacterId: string;
  baseType: string;
  origin?: string;
  history?: string;
  fundamentalDynamic?: string;
  writerNotes?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

export interface RelationshipWithCharacters extends CharacterRelationship {
  fromCharacter: Character;
  toCharacter: Character;
  relationshipStates: RelationshipState[];
}

// Core service methods
-createRelationshipPair() - // Creates bidirectional relationships
  getCharacterRelationships() - // Character's perspective on all relationships
  updateRelationshipWithSync() - // Update with smart sync option
  getRelationshipHistory(); // Timeline of relationship evolution
```

### API Routes Structure

Following established `/api/novels/[id]/characters/[characterId]/` pattern:

- `GET/POST /api/novels/[id]/characters/[characterId]/relationships`
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/novels/[id]/characters/[characterId]/relationships/[relationshipId]`
- `GET/POST /api/novels/[id]/characters/[characterId]/relationships/[relationshipId]/states`
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/novels/[id]/characters/[characterId]/relationships/[relationshipId]/states/[stateId]`

## üé£ React Hooks Architecture

Following established useCharacters/useCharacterStates patterns:

### Core Hooks

- `useCharacterRelationships(characterId)` - Main relationship management
- `useRelationshipStates(relationshipId)` - State CRUD operations
- `useCreateRelationship()` - Simplified creation with bidirectional support
- `useUpdateRelationship()` - Updates with smart sync options
- `useDeleteRelationship()` - Handles bidirectional deletion

## üé® UI Component Structure

Following established component organization patterns:

### Component Hierarchy

```
src/app/components/characters/character-detail-content/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ character-relationships/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ character-relationships-section.tsx        # Main container (exists)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ relationships-grid.tsx                     # Display grid
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ relationship-card.tsx                      # Individual relationship
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ create-relationship-dialog.tsx             # Creation form
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ edit-relationship-dialog.tsx               # Edit with smart sync
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ relationship-detail-view.tsx               # Expanded timeline view
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ relationship-states-timeline.tsx           # States evolution
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ relationship-sync-controls.tsx             # Smart sync UI
```

### Key UI Features

- **Relationship Cards**: Show other character + relationship summary from current character's perspective
- **Timeline View**: Detailed relationship evolution (mirrors character states timeline)
- **Bidirectional View**: Switch between perspectives in relationship detail
- **Smart Sync Toggle**: Optional automatic synchronization of reciprocal relationships

## üîÑ Smart Synchronization System

### Core Concept

When editing a relationship, users can optionally enable "Smart Sync" to automatically update the reciprocal relationship with intelligent defaults.

### Smart Sync Features

- **Toggle Control**: Enable/disable per edit operation
- **Preview Mode**: Show exactly what changes will be applied to reciprocal relationship
- **Granular Controls**: Choose which fields to sync (trust, conflict, type, power balance)
- **Intensity Slider**: Control how much influence changes have (10%-100%)
- **User Preferences**: Remember default sync settings

### Smart Sync Logic Examples

- **Trust Level**: 70% influence on reciprocal trust
- **Conflict Level**: Mirror changes exactly
- **Relationship Type**: Smart mapping (mentor ‚Üî student, ally ‚Üî ally)
- **Power Balance**: Inverse mapping (a_dominant ‚Üî b_dominant)

## üöÄ User Experience Flow

### Creating Relationships

1. **From Character A's page**: Click "Add Relationship"
2. **Select Character B**: ComboSelect with search
3. **Set relationship data**: Form with smart reciprocal suggestions
4. **Auto-creation**: System creates both A‚ÜíB and B‚ÜíA relationships
5. **Immediate visibility**: Relationship appears on both character pages

### Editing Relationships

1. **Smart Sync Toggle**: Choose automatic vs independent editing
2. **Real-time Preview**: See reciprocal changes before applying
3. **Granular Control**: Advanced sync settings for power users
4. **Perspective Switching**: View/edit from either character's perspective

### Relationship Timeline

1. **Base Relationship Card**: Static foundation info
2. **States Timeline**: Evolution over story (mirrors character states UI)
3. **Bidirectional Views**: Side-by-side perspectives
4. **Integration**: Links to character states and manuscript scenes
