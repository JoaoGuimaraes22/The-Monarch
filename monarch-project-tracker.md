# The Monarch Story Platform - Updated Project Tracker

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a story development platform tailored for _The Monarch_ epic fantasy series, focusing on practical utility over marketing fluff.

**User**: Aspiring fantasy writer building a complex narrative management system  
**Philosophy**: Build what's genuinely useful, component-first architecture, dark theme matching Claude interface

## 🎨 Design System

**Theme**: Clean black/white/red aesthetic

- **Backgrounds**: `bg-black` (headers), `bg-gray-900` (pages), `bg-gray-800` (cards), `bg-gray-700` (inputs)
- **Text**: `text-white` (primary), `text-gray-300` (secondary), `text-gray-400` (tertiary)
- **Accents**: `text-red-500` (highlights), `border-red-700` (active states)
- **NO gradients or fancy effects** - clean and minimal like Claude interface

## 🎉 Recently Completed Features

### **🎉 FINALIZED: Complete Contextual Import System Design**

**Achievement**: Designed the perfect import flow with explicit target selection and smart positioning

**Key Innovations**:

1. **✅ Eliminated "Current" Context Confusion**

   - ❌ Removed all "add to current" modes that were ambiguous
   - ✅ **Always explicit target selection** - user chooses exactly where content goes

2. **✅ Universal Smart Positioning Pattern**

   - **Beginning/End for Speed**: One-click access to most common positions
   - **Specific Position for Precision**: Insert at exact position with visual bumping preview
   - **Consistent Across All Levels**: Same pattern for Acts, Chapters, Scenes

3. **✅ Perfect User Flow Design**

   ```
   Add New Chapter:
   1. Choose Act (Act 1 • The Island)
   2. Position: Beginning | End | Specific Position 2
   3. Preview: Items 2+ become 3+ (bumping shown clearly)
   ```

4. **✅ Clean Mode Organization**

   - **Add New**: Act, Chapter, Scene (with positioning)
   - **Replace**: Act, Chapter, Scene (direct selection, no positioning)
   - **Button Text**: Clean - "Replace Act" not "Replace Existing Act"

5. **✅ Smart Navigation Flow**

   - **Add modes**: Always end with position selection
   - **Replace modes**: Go straight to file upload after target selection
   - **Context-aware back buttons**: Return to appropriate previous step

6. **✅ Visual Clarity Everywhere**
   - **Order + Title Display**: "Act 1 • The Island", "Chapter 2 • The Revelation"
   - **Status Indicators**: "Will Replace" badges, position previews
   - **Bumping Logic Preview**: Shows exactly what moves where

**Implementation Status**: ✅ **UI Flow Complete** - Full dialog designed and implemented

- Fixed middleware context preservation and file handling
- Complete auto-fix system with advanced title pattern matching
- Professional error handling and user feedback
- Backward/forward compatible API response formats

### **🎉 FINALIZED: Complete API Route Modernization**

**Achievement**: All API routes use modern parameter objects, professional validation, and standardized responses

**Implementation**: ✅ **ALL ENDPOINTS MODERNIZED**

- Type-safe parameter object methods for all services
- Professional Zod validation for all requests/responses
- Cross-entity operations (scenes between chapters, chapters between acts)
- Configurable rate limiting with development/production settings
